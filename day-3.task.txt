                Difference between DOCUMENTS , SCREEN  and WINDOWS OBJECTS

                                                                          WINDOWS
Definition:
     The windows object is a built-in object in JavaScript that allows developers to 
access and manipulate the Windows operating system. It provides access to system 
information, such as the user's home directory, the currently logged -in user, system
settings, and the list of running processes. Additionally, it can be used to access
and manipulate the windows registry, create new processes, and control system-level events.

                                                                      DOCUMENTS
Definition:
     When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Mode for the page.
The document object represents the whole HTML document as a tree of Objects
(HTML, HEAD, BOIDY, and other HTML tags). It is the root element that represents
the HTML document.


   DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOCUMENT, SCREEN AND WINDOWS OBJECT:
________________________________________________________

Windows and Document objects are not the same:

   ⦁The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser.
   ⦁This window object has the majority of the properties like length, 
innerwidth, inner height, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

   ⦁The document object is your HTML, aspx, php, or other document that will be
loaded that will be loaded into the browser.
   ⦁the  document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties
available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc...
   ⦁The really this doing means That  means if you want to access a property for the
window it is window. property, if it is document it is window. document property which 
is also available in short as document property.
   ⦁The window object also has a screen object  with properties descriving the physical display.
   ⦁Screen properties width and height are the full screen.
   ⦁Screen properties availWidth and availHeigt omit the toolbar.
  ⦁The portion of a screen displaying the rendered document is the 
viewport in javascript, which is potentially confusing because we call an application's portion
of the screen a window when talking about interactions with the operating system.
   ⦁The get Bounding Client React() method of any document element with return an object with 
top, left, bottom, and right properties describing the location of the element in the viewport.
